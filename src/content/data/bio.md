## Welcome!
My Name is William Sutton, I am a recent graduate from the University of South Carolina.  

### Bio
My experiences at the Koger Center for the Arts, where I produce a 2-hour weekly live radio show, have honed my ability to thrive in a fast-paced, team-oriented environment while maintaining professionalism on the air. As a former Vice president and team captain of the USC Cybersecurity Club, I led a group of talented students in the 2022 Palmetto Cyber Defense Competition, receiving the MVP award. My time at Cycrypt, a local cybersecurity solutions firm, provided valuable real-world experience in consumer-oriented software development and meeting strict deadlines.

Combining academic achievements, practical experiences, and industry certifications, I possess a comprehensive perspective on software development and security. I am eager to contribute my technical expertise, leadership skills, and adaptability.
